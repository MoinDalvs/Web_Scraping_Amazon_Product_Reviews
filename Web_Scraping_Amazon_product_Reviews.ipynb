       " <span>Nord CE 2 is a decent choice for someone looking to upgrade from an under 15k segment phone. Review after using the 6GB variant for 5 days:<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Decent battery life and excellent charging speed<br/>- Smooth performance and display<br/>- Comparatively compact and light weight<br/>- \"Unofficial\" water resistance (read below)<br/>- Design and color is neat<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Speaker isn't great<br/>- Camera is okayish<br/>- Unsure of OS experience in the future, stable and bloat free as of now<br/><br/>Detailed:<br/>- Decent battery life and performance. I got around 7 to 8 hrs of screen time from battery at 100% to 20% with normal use with 4G internet (social media, chat, some camera and mobile hotspot tethering at 90HZ display refresh rate). Changing display refresh rate to 60Hz seems to improve battery drain, but 90Hz looks very smooth.<br/>- 65W fast charging is great, can charge from 20% to 100% in 30 minutes. Also not much heating during charging.<br/>- OS looks clean, some preinstalled apps could be uninstalled or disabled. But surprisingly found 3 file manager apps (of which two can be disabled) and two photos app (OnePlus Gallery and Google Photos app, which can't be uninstalled). Didn't find any bugs or functionality issue, no lags or stuttering. Apps open instantly and work fine. OxygenOS 11.3 with Feb 2022 security patch. I guess a stable Android 11 is better than a buggier Android 12 for most customers. But not sure what will happen from OxygenOS 12 which shares Oppo's ColorOS.<br/>- Some heating issue was there on a first day of use, but then got a system update and haven't noticed any heating afterwards.<br/>- Saw a rubber seal for the SIM tray, which could mean that there is some degree of water resistance, but there is no official IP rating. Also saw a YouTube video that tests the water resistance and the phone survived 15 min submersion in water. So there seems to be \"unofficial\" water resistance.<br/>- Cameras are okayish. Main cam takes good pictures at good lighting, but colors are a bit saturated. In wide angle camera, the exposure and color is less. Photos from selfie cam are a bit soft without any filters or modes. Haven't tested much low light or night photography.<br/>- Phone back panel is made of plastic, feels like plastic to touch but the blue color back panel looks really good. Good to hold in hand and use because of comparatively compact and thin size. A smaller bottom chin / bezel would have been better. The case provided is translucent and has a small pattern design (ie its not a plain).<br/><br/>Overall it's a good phone to buy, you get some features like headphone jack and expandable memory which is good for people who have been using it from their previous phones.</span>\n",

Otherwise go for real me gt master or 9pro or 9pro plus.  And moto mobiles also good. I was using moto for 6years for only good camera and sound i took this but those two only drawback for this phone rest all okay manageble. And no return policy only replacement.</span>\n",

       " 'Nord CE 2 is a decent choice for someone looking to upgrade from an under 15k segment phone. Review after using the 6GB variant for 5 days:Pros:- Decent battery life and excellent charging speed- Smooth performance and display- Comparatively compact and light weight- \"Unofficial\" water resistance (read below)- Design and color is neatCons:- Speaker isn\\'t great- Camera is okayish- Unsure of OS experience in the future, stable and bloat free as of nowDetailed:- Decent battery life and performance. I got around 7 to 8 hrs of screen time from battery at 100% to 20% with normal use with 4G internet (social media, chat, some camera and mobile hotspot tethering at 90HZ display refresh rate). Changing display refresh rate to 60Hz seems to improve battery drain, but 90Hz looks very smooth.- 65W fast charging is great, can charge from 20% to 100% in 30 minutes. Also not much heating during charging.- OS looks clean, some preinstalled apps could be uninstalled or disabled. But surprisingly found 3 file manager apps (of which two can be disabled) and two photos app (OnePlus Gallery and Google Photos app, which can\\'t be uninstalled). Didn\\'t find any bugs or functionality issue, no lags or stuttering. Apps open instantly and work fine. OxygenOS 11.3 with Feb 2022 security patch. I guess a stable Android 11 is better than a buggier Android 12 for most customers. But not sure what will happen from OxygenOS 12 which shares Oppo\\'s ColorOS.- Some heating issue was there on a first day of use, but then got a system update and haven\\'t noticed any heating afterwards.- Saw a rubber seal for the SIM tray, which could mean that there is some degree of water resistance, but there is no official IP rating. Also saw a YouTube video that tests the water resistance and the phone survived 15 min submersion in water. So there seems to be \"unofficial\" water resistance.- Cameras are okayish. Main cam takes good pictures at good lighting, but colors are a bit saturated. In wide angle camera, the exposure and color is less. Photos from selfie cam are a bit soft without any filters or modes. Haven\\'t tested much low light or night photography.- Phone back panel is made of plastic, feels like plastic to touch but the blue color back panel looks really good. Good to hold in hand and use because of comparatively compact and thin size. A smaller bottom chin / bezel would have been better. The case provided is translucent and has a small pattern design (ie its not a plain).Overall it\\'s a good phone to buy, you get some features like headphone jack and expandable memory which is good for people who have been using it from their previous phones.',\n",
